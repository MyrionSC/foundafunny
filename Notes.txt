todo mainpage:
Settings
    Themes (black and white)
Connection error handling (could be as soon as socket.io looses connection)
Sort timers by ActivationTime in db gettimers function
Do something about showing a lot of timers (limit gotten amount or slider)
    slider for favorites as well
communicate error messages to client when db operations fail etc.
on normal content change, send it to other clients before saving in db
    test if it is a problem first. The current way is safer.
Make small notification popups (in a not annoying way) for everything (incoming and local changes)
Parse Youtube: Add parsing of time in video
fix weekly timers
    Activation time does not update correctly

todo frontpage:
Rework the design, test out bootstrap styles
On page creation, print new page url in textbox with copy-to-clipboard button in side


Could have:
A timecounter for the page timezone
emoticons in text
twitter support
9gag support


Bugs:
Going from history to set timer sometimes destroy datetimepicker.
    It is $location.set({}) that does it. Try some combinations to fix it (currently disabled).
frontpage img might be fucked. It atleast doesn't do sizes right.
Going from frontpage to anything else does not instantly remove input bar
History possibly gotten twice (it's written twice in server logs at least)
if you change views via adressbar, sidebar fucks up
History: if there is 10 contents, you can push get next content and get 0 content
At some point, I should do away with the automatic center for everything else than frontpage,
    but there is no way I'm doing it soon :P
Weekly timer content might be added twice at activation
Frontpage is only updated when mouse is moved. Probably something with angular, should try calling apply
    various places.


Notes:
When setting timers, should the user be allowed to set seconds? Should ask the group what they think.
How long should users be allowed to set timer ActivationLength? Anything more than 1000 sec would
    probably be stupid
The values in setTimer are almost certainly wrong for various tz's, but that is a problem for a later date
bootstrap via cdn sometimes takes a few seconds to load. consider placing it locally if problems persists.
Should timer activation content be added to db when no one is online? Should it be added at all?
Remember to monkeytest content input. Too long contents will fuck history view up, I guarantee it!
    (maybe not anymore with bootstrap


On timezones:
Using an offset value corresponding to the timezone of the client works. I just have to be able to calculate the correct
offset at page generation time, by making the user choose in which timezone the page should be located. That should be
changeable from the settings menu. But that is further down the line. A lot of testing required, but mainly just value
tuning, so should be easy (and boring...)
