----- DOING -----

Add more input to timers, select randomly when activating
    1: use arrays for timer input (DONE)
    2: Allow for adding / deleting input
        - on create timer
            - create dialog with input field where one can add content
                and listview where one can see and delete content.
                Can be used for

----- TO DO -----

todo userpage:
- Do something about showing a lot of timers (limit gotten amount or slider)
    slider for favorites as well
- communicate error messages to client when db operations fail etc.
- Make small notification popups (in a not annoying way) for everything (incoming and local changes)
- enable / disable timer option
- See if it is possible to determine what kind of resource something is with a http call before deciding what to do
    Regex is not too good, because it is impossible to catch everything
    Try to use iframe for everything
- Make properties of timers able to be changed
- Name favorites

todo generationpage:
- Rework the design, test out bootstrap styles. Check out some framework pages for inspiration (emberjs, angular, react)
- On page creation, print new page url in textbox with copy-to-clipboard button in side


todo: server
- Add "page last accessed" date attribute on page
- change logs so everything is correctly delimited. (print * at beginning of action)

todo: all
- remove fontcolour and bgcolour. It is replaced by theme
- make better "page not found" page

Could have:
- A timecounter for the page timezone
- emoticons in text
- twitter support
- 9gag support (have to be tested, doesn't seem to work)
- Option to have more minimised option bar
- Slack plugin, to add content without going to faf page

----- BUGS -----

-- Important --
- fix weekly timers
    When the client and servers date don't match, the UpdateActivationTime function does
        not calculate the time correctly. Most likely line 313 is the problem.
            Exibit 1 (client two hours ahead):
                Client time: wednesday 01.00
                Server time: tuesday 11.00
                The server shoots wrong by one day
            possible solution: use time of client to calculate new activation time
- If multiple timers have expired when starting server, not all is deleted

- doesn't seem like resize works on youtube and twitch
    Everything in rezise directive is commented, would be a good place to start..
- Look what happens when you change timezone in the middle of a timer activation
- Going from history to set timer sometimes destroy datetimepicker.
    It is $location.set({}) that does it. Try some combinations to fix it (currently disabled).
- History possibly gotten twice (it's written twice in server logs at least)
- if you change views via adressbar, sidebar fucks up
- History: if there are 10 contents, you can push get next content and get 0 content
- Weekly timer content might be added twice at activation
- When redirecting from heroku domain to custom domain, hash routing is lost
    It might not be bad actually, atleast the mainpage is better for it imo
- Sometimes on load the frontpage favorite star is not lit if content favorite
- When changing timezones, if timers are after activation time they arctivate. This shouldn't happen.
    For single time timers: They should be deleted
    For weekly timers: they should be updated
- When putting in new content after a timer activation the timer shouldn't activate its endcontent.
- When changing timezones, hours are added when they should be removed

----- Notes -----

- When setting timers, should the user be allowed to set seconds? Should ask the group what they think.
- How long should users be allowed to set timer ActivationLength? Anything more than 1000 sec would
    probably be stupid
- bootstrap via cdn sometimes takes a few seconds to load. consider placing it locally if problems persists.
- Should timer activation content be added to db when no one is online? Should it be added at all?
- Remember to monkeytest content input. Too long contents will fuck history view up, I guarantee it!
    (maybe not anymore with bootstrap
- Time zone shifts (like shift from winter to summer time) doesn't change timers and pagetime accordingly
    I'm thinking that people can shift the pagetime themselves when their time shifts
    I just have to provide the functionality of course.
- If I delete pages from the db manually the server cracks if someone were on them.

---- Before Release -----

- Find stable versions of dependencies and use those instead of the newest versions always.

----- Random thoughts -----

On timezones:
Using an offset value corresponding to the timezone of the client works. I just have to be able to calculate the correct
offset at page generation time, by making the user choose in which timezone the page should be located. That should be
changeable from the settings menu. But that is further down the line. A lot of testing required, but mainly just value
tuning, so should be easy (and boring...)

On "dynamic" page serving:
Seems that you normally inject javascript into the header of a statically served
html page to achieve that dynamic nature of a statically served page. I just look at
the last part of the page url, as that is the only thing i need. But that might not
be following conventions. If I ever need more, I will probably look into doing it the right way.
